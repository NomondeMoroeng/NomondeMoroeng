**From Curiosity to CyberSecurity: My IT Journey**  

I am a dedicated IT professional, but my journey started with nothing more than curiosity. Growing up, I was always fascinated by how technology worked‚Äîhow websites loaded, how networks connected, and how cyber threats were prevented. This curiosity led me to pursue a diploma in Information Technology, specializing in systems development with a strong focus on cybersecurity.  

During my studies, I explored various areas of IT, from programming in PHP and Java to database management with MySQL. However, it wasn‚Äôt until I took cybersecurity courses, including the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and Cisco Networking Academy programs, that I truly found my passion. The idea of protecting systems and data from cyber threats excited me, and I knew this was the field I wanted to build my career in.  

Determined to expand my knowledge, I dived into hands-on learning through TryHackMe and other cybersecurity labs. I also worked on real-world projects, including phishing awareness simulations and secure web application development. Along the way, I realized that cloud security was the future, and I decided to merge my cybersecurity expertise with cloud technologies.  

Now, I am preparing for multiple certifications, including CompTIA A+ and AZ-900, to sharpen my skills and position myself for a career as a Cyber Analyst. While my journey is still ongoing, each step has reinforced my passion for cybersecurity and cloud security.  

I share my story to inspire those who are just starting or considering a transition into IT. With dedication, continuous learning, and a willingness to embrace new challenges, anyone can carve out a successful career in this ever-evolving field.
